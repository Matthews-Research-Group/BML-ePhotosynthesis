## BioCro [![Build Status](https://github.com/ebimodeling/biocro-dev/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ebimodeling/biocro-dev/actions?query=workflow%3AR-CMD-check)
BioCro is a model that predicts plant growth over time given crop-specific parameters and environmental data as input.

It uses models of key physiological and biophysical processes underlying plant growth ([Humphries and Long, 1995]), and has previously been used for predicting biomass yield and leaf area index of switchgrass and miscanthus ([Miguez et al., 2009]).

BioCro has also been integrated into a suite of tools that link the model directly to crop trait and yield data ([LeBauer et al., 2014]). The Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer ([PEcAn](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan)) couples BioCro to the [Biofuel Ecophysiological Traits and Yields database](https://www.betydb.org).

### An example
The `run_biocro()` function accepts initial values, parameters, climate variables, and sets of modules to run. It returns the results in a data frame.

```r
library(BioCro)
library(lattice)

result <- with(soybean, {run_biocro(
  initial_values,
  parameters,
  soybean_weather$'2002',
  direct_modules,
  differential_modules,
  ode_solver
)})

xyplot(Stem + Leaf ~ TTc, data = result, type='l', auto = TRUE)
```

There are parameters and modules for soybean (_Glycine max_), miscanthus (_Miscanthus_ x _giganteus_), and willow (_Saliceae salix_).


### Installation
#### Requirements
- The [R environment](https://cran.r-project.org/) version 3.5.0 or greater.
- On Windows, a version of [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) appropriate for your version of R.
- On Linux, gcc and g++ version 4.9.3 or greater (consult documentation for your distribution for installation instructions).
- On MacOS, Xcode.

#### Installation steps
Download the BioCro source code from GitHub, unzip the file, and install from the either the command line or from within R using one of the following sets of commands.

Do one of the sets of instruction below. These assume that the source files are in a directory named "biocro".

- From the command line
```
cd path_to_unzipped_directory
R CMD INSTALL biocro
```

- Or from within R
```
setwd('path_to_unzipped_directory')
install.packages('biocro', repos=NULL, type='SOURCE')
```

Please see the [contribution guidelines](documentation/contribution_guidelines.md) before submitting changes.

### Software Documentation

See the [BioCro Documentation Web
Site](https://ebimodeling.github.io/biocro-documentation/).  There
will be found not only the standard package documentation, but also
documentation of the C++ code, including notes on the biological
models used in BioCro and their implementation.  Also included is
documentation for BioCro package developers and maintainers.
