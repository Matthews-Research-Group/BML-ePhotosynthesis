# WARNING: The .Rbuildignore syntax has no way to indicate a comment, so all the
# lines in this file that begin with `#` are actually commands to exclude files
# with peculiar names that include substrings like `# subdirectories.`. For this
# reason, there should not be any blank comment lines, because they would
# exclude any files with `#` in the filename, possibly causing confusing issues.

^.*\.Rproj$
# Designates the directory as an RStudio Project.

^\.Rproj\.user$
# Used by RStudio for temporary files.

/\.RData
# Only a root level .RData file is ignored by default.
